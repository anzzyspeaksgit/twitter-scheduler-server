# Twitter Repost Assistant - Instructions

## ✅ What's Fixed:

1. **Reduced console spam** - Only important events are logged now
2. **Extension context error handling** - Better handling when extension is reloaded
3. **Post Now button** - Added to each draft card in the popup

## 🔄 After Making Changes:

**ALWAYS refresh the page after reloading the extension!**

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click the refresh icon (↻) on the extension
3. **Refresh the Twitter/X page** (important!)
4. The extension will work properly again

## 📝 How to Use:

### Save Tweets:
1. Go to Twitter/X
2. Find a tweet you like
3. Click the **"Save"** button that appears in the tweet actions
4. You'll see "Saved!" confirmation

### Post or Schedule:
1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. You'll see your saved drafts
3. For each draft you can:
   - **Post Now** - Simulates posting (see console for details)
   - **Auto Schedule** - Automatically schedules for optimal time
   - **Edit** - Modify the tweet text
   - **Delete** - Remove the draft

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### About "Extension context invalidated" Error:
- This happens when you reload the extension
- **Solution**: Just refresh the Twitter page
- The extension will show a message telling you to refresh

### About Twitter API:
- Your OAuth 2.0 credentials **cannot post tweets** (Twitter limitation)
- The extension **simulates posting** for testing
- To actually post, you'd need OAuth 1.0a tokens
- Check the console to see what would be posted

## 🎯 Console Output (Minimal):
- `🐦 Save button clicked!` - When you click save
- `🐦 Saving tweet: [first 50 chars]...` - Shows what's being saved
- `✅ Tweet saved successfully!` - Confirmation
- `✅ Tweet saved as draft: [first 50 chars]...` - Background confirmation

✅ Auto-schedule for optimal times  
✅ "Post Now" button (simulated)  
✅ Edit and delete drafts  
✅ Minimal console logging  

## 🔧 If Something Breaks:
1. Reload extension
2. **Refresh the Twitter page**
3. Try again

That's it! The extension is ready to use with minimal console output.
